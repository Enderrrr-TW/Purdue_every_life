The codes in this folder are revised from yanx27's repo: https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch.
I convert the classifcation network into regression network.
- Use farthest point sampling to extract the same amount of points from each plot collected on different dates
- Use train_test_split.ipynb to prepare the json files for 10 fold cross validation. You need to get the plot id in each fold from ./Check_variety.ipynb
- There are various versions for training. I used train_test at the end.
